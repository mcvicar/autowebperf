Think of it as a poorly conceived and written cucumber version of YSlow or Google Page Speed.

Requires (at the moment):
* Cucumber with webrat and mechanize gems
* be_valid_asset gem (http://github.com/unboxed/be_valid_asset) for HTML and CSS validation

In the future* I plan to move to using watir-webdriver with watir-webdriver-performance




* About roughly the same time as when terrible cyborg dinosaurs have enslaved humanity
